Here's the deal...

A typical input line may require three general kinds of processing:
  - formatting such as boldface, italics, etc.
  - variable expansion
  - function call expansion

In the past, these have all been handled "simultaneously" in a 
single method. This has made the code complex and fragile.

I had the idea of handling these in sequence instead of all at once.
Additionally, there "could" be times I only want to do one or two
of these operations.

In addition, the current code doesn't work for the case where a
variable is passed to a function. While I don't intend to write a
full "language" as such, this use case seems reasonable to me.

I'm thinking through this, so I'll make up an example.

  .set num1=5, num2=10
  *[Hi, there!] I am $User, and my _totally random number is $$rand[$num1,$num2].

First pass:

  <b>Hi, there!</b> I am $User, and my <i>totally</i> random number is $$rand[$num1,$num2].

Second pass: 

  <b>Hi, there!</b> I am Hal, and my <i>totally</i> random number is $$rand[5,10].
 
Third pass: 

  <b>Hi, there!</b> I am Hal, and my <i>totally</i> random number is 7.
