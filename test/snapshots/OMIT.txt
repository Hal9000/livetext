  error_no_such_inc      Output BEFORE error doesn't get passed through
  error_no_such_copy     ^ Same behavior as  error_no_such_inc
  error_no_such_mixin    ^ Same behavior as error_missing_end
  error_invalid_name     ^ Same behavior as error_no_such_inc
  error_missing_end      Output is duplicated somehow. Look for: puts @body or puts @main.body
  error_inc_line_num     Forgot what's wrong here
  simple_import          Not coded yet
# icanhaz                Dummy command similar to import/mixin
