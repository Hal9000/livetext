error_no_such_inc      Output BEFORE error doesn't get passed through
error_no_such_copy     ^ Same behavior as  error_no_such_inc
simple_mixin           Mixin doesn't work?? But no error... maybe _def isn't working.
error_missing_end      Output is duplicated somehow. Look for: puts @body or puts @main.body
error_no_such_mixin    ^ Same behavior as error_missing_end
error_line_num         Same behavior as error_missing_end
error_invalid_name     ^ Same behavior as error_no_such_inc
# more_complex_vars      ^ Bug related to var_func_parse in formatline.rb?
