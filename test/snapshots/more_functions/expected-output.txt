Testing some more functions here...
<p>

Here I am calling a function  with 
a colon parameter...
<p>

<p>

Next let's <b>do*</b> something with our parameter:
<p>

I'll call these variants...
<p>

"Motel" spelled backwards is letom :)
<p>

"lamina" reversed is animal
<p>

I can also use the erutaef tekcarb here.
<p>

If I don't use a parameter for [Error evaluating $$reverse()] - it gives
me an error. (Bug or feature??)
<p>

What if a function doesn't use parameters at all, but
we pass them? Hmm...
<p>

Now we succeed and succeed some more
and finally we succeed in life.
<p>

But can we succeed, when our beds are burning?
