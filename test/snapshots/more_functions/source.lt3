Testing some more functions here...

.func just_do_it
  item = param
  # Do "something" with the parameter...
  return ""  # parameter disappears!
.end

Here I am calling a function $$just_do_it:foobar with 
a colon parameter...


Next let's *do something with our parameter:

.func reverse
  param.reverse   # just reverse it
.end

I'll call these variants...

"Motel" spelled backwards is $$reverse:motel :)

"lamina" reversed is $$reverse:lamina

I can also use the $$reverse[bracket feature] here.

If I don't use a parameter for $$reverse - it gives
me an error. (Bug or feature??)

What if a function doesn't use parameters at all, but
we pass them? Hmm...

.func meditate 
   "succeed"   # just replaces params with this verb
.end

Now we $$meditate:slowly and $$meditate some more
and finally we $$meditate[on various things] in life.

But can we $$meditate, when our beds are burning?
