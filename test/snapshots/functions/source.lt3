Testing out
some functions 
here...

.func myfunc
  "Eureka!"
.end

I am calling $$myfunc here...
Let's see 
what happens.

Functions can take a parameter in brackets 
(which it can parse itself as needed):

.func mean
  list = param.split(",").map(&:to_f)
  sum = list.inject(0, :+)
  avg = sum / list.size.to_f
  avg.to_s
.end

The result is $$mean[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] as I see it.

Some functions like date and time are predefined.
