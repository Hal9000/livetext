h This file specifies which snapshots will/won't be run.

# Blank lines and comments are ignored.
# Other lines:  name_of_snapshot and any comments here are ignored (no # needed)

# You can start by uncommenting one of these:
# Default INCLUDE all
# Default EXCLUDE all
# If you use neither, INCLUDE is the default (but explicit is better)

# If you include all, you can specify exclusions with an x:
# x  my_test_name           # this is a comment

# Likewise if you EXCLUDE all, you can specify inclusions with an i:
# i  some_other_test        # this is a comment

# The i and x (to include/exclude) must be the first token on
#   the line (preceding the test name)

# Note that QUIT (on a line by itself) will stop processing the file


# Others (usually passing):

# import/include/mixin, others...
