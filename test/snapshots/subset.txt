# This file specifies which snapshots will/won't be run.

# Blank lines and comments are ignored.
# Other lines:  name_of_snapshot and any comments here are ignored (no # needed)

# You can start by uncommenting one of these:
# Default INCLUDE all
# Default EXCLUDE all
# If you use neither, INCLUDE is the default (but explicit is better)

# If you include all, you can specify exclusions with an x:
# x  my_test_name           # this is a comment

# Likewise if you EXCLUDE all, you can specify inclusions with an i:
# i  some_other_test        # this is a comment

# The i and x (to include/exclude) must be the first token on
#   the line (preceding the test name)

# Note that QUIT (on a line by itself) will stop processing the file

x  error_no_such_inc        # Output BEFORE error doesn't get passed through ("leading" output)
x  error_no_such_copy       # ^ Same behavior as  error_no_such_inc
x  error_no_such_mixin      # ^ Same behavior as error_missing_end
x  error_invalid_name       # ^ Same behavior as error_no_such_inc
x  error_missing_end        # Output is duplicated somehow. Look for: puts @body or puts @main.body
x  error_inc_line_num       # Forgot what's wrong here

# Dummy command .icanhaz works like .mixin or .import

x  icanhaz                  # "Leading" output doesn't get generated (same as error_no_such_inc)
