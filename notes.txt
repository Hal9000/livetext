Mostly done
-----------
define variables
define methods
allow switching sigils, etc.
.raw
.mixin
.include
double sigil + blank = true comment 
sigil + blank = passthru comment 
double sigil + token = internal sigil
.comment/.end
.func


To Be Done
----------
better variable support
need a 'require' (with sigil?)
.init ?
Prioritized formatting: markdown b/i/c, lt b/i/c, emdash, varsub, funcsub, etc.?
em dash
variable for source file
variable for line number
ignore trailing punctuation for * _ `
args vs bare args (quotes)
comment!  pass this thru as comment
comment!/end
.proc
.break to eof ?
warn when overriding?
.meth?/.end  (.else?)
$var.subvar
$$func $$func(params)



Undecided
---------
encourage overriding passthru?
disallow leading underscore
HTML entities?
explicit Unicode support?
intermediate format prior to output?
.say
.debug
.dump
links? 
images?
safe level?
exceptions?
.if, .else ?
.shell ?
table styles?
define "quotes" such as * _ ?
Issues: 
  - substitution and bold/italics on @data and @args?
  - substitution before or after bold/italics?
.run  Arbitrary Ruby code?
BEGIN/END for require or mixin?
other langs??
configurable delimiters (tables, etc.)



For bookish
-----------
.index 
.indexable


Assignment
----------
myvar=foo
myvar.x = "This and that"
$myvar
$myvar.x
$(myvar.x)

Functions
---------
$$func
$$func.blah
$$(func.blah)
$$proc ?
$$(func args)

Predef functions?
-----------------
$$sourceline
$index

What is Livetext?
-----------------
It's a text transformer
Agnostic about output format
Like a macro processor but not
Like markdown but not
Like erb or HAML but not
Later on - language agnostic?
Like an old-fashioned text formatter, but extensible
Plugin-oriented
Aims to be easy/flexible but not too dangerous
Predefine but don't clutter namespace
Mention softcover

Tutorial
--------
What is it?
Any text file is (probably) valid
Simple built-in methods
Pass-through mode
Comments
Methods with bodies
Changing sigils
Reusing text and code
Predefined stuff: methods, functions, variables, libs?
Defining your own code: inline, methods, func, proc, ...
require, include
variables
functions

Mixins etc
----------
PlainHTML
PDFout
Bookish
InlineMarkdown
Pygments


Logic:
------
Handle . .. .name 
In each body:
  - allow . and ..
  - handle ..name
  - disallow .name ?
  - handle italics
  - handle substitution
