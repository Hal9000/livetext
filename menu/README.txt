1. I'm trying to create a simple, flexible dropdown menu. I was 
working from a thing I found, but I am open to doing it
other ways.

2. The CSS does seem *horrendous* to me, and I don't understand it.

3. I'd like to "parameterize" it -- specify height/colors, maybe
   other stuff. See arg1, arg2, ...

4. The notation inside the .menu block is very arbitrary, for my
   convenience in coding quickly. Open to doing it other ways.
