<p><center><h2>Livetext: A smart processor for text</h2></center></p>

<p>Livetext is simply a tool for transforming text from one format into another. The source file
has commands embedded in it, and the output is dependent on those commands.  </p>

<p>Why is this special? It&#39;s very flexible, very extensible, and it&#39;s extensible <i>in Ruby</i>.  </p>

<p><br><br><b><font size=+1>Why Livetext?</font></b><br></p>

<p>Livetext grew out of several motivations. One was a desire for a markup language that would permit
me to write articles (and even books) in my own way and on my own terms. I&#39;ve done this more
than once (and I know others who have, as well).   </p>

<p>I liked Softcover, but I found it to be very complex. I never liked Markdown much -- it is very
dumb and not extensible at all.  </p>

<p>I wanted something that had the basic functionality of all my ad hoc solutions but allowed 
extensions. Then my old solutions would be like subsets of the new format. This was a generalization
similar to the way we began several years ago to view HTML as a subset of XML.  </p>

<p><br><br><b><font size=+1>What is Livetext really?</font></b><br></p>

<p>Here goes:
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s a text transformer
</li>
<li>It&#39;s Ruby-based (later on, more language agnostic)
</li>
<li>It&#39;s (potentially) agnostic about output format
</li>
<li>It&#39;s designed to be flexible, extensible, and easy
</li>
<li>It&#39;s designed to be &quot;plugin&quot; oriented
</li>
<li>It&#39;s like an old-fashioned text formatter (but extensible)
</li>
<li>It&#39;s like a macro processor (but not)
</li>
<li>It&#39;s like markdown and others (but not)
</li>
<li>It&#39;s like erb or HAML (but not)
</li>
<li>It&#39;s powerful but not too dangerous
</li>
<li>It&#39;s not necesarily a markdown replacement
</li>
<li>It&#39;s definitely not a softcover replacement
</li>
<li>It could possibly augment markdown, softcover, others
</li>
</ul></p>

<p><br><br><b><font size=+1>How does it work?</font></b><br></p>

<p>A Livetext file is simply a text file which may have commands interspersed. A command is
simply a period followed by a name and optional parameters (at the beginning of a line).  </p>

<p>The period is configurable if you want to use another character. The names are (for now)
actual Ruby method names, so names such as <tt>to_s</tt> and <tt>inspect</tt> are currently not allowed.  </p>

<p>Currently I am mostly emitting &quot;dumb HTML&quot; or Markdown as output. In theory, you can write
code (or use someone else&#39;s) to manipulate text in any way and output any format. Technically,
you could even emit PDF, PNG, or SVG formats.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible to embed comments in the text, or even to pass them through to the output 
in commented form.  </p>

<p>The command <tt>.end</tt> is special, marking the end of a body of text. Some commands may operate on
a block of lines rather than just a few parameters. (A text block is like a here-document.)
There is no method name corresponding to the <tt>.end</tt> command.</p>

<p>The file extension I&#39;ve chosen is <tt>.lt</tt> (though this may change). <b>Note:</b> The source for this 
README is a <tt>.lt</tt> file which uses its own little <i>ad hoc</i> library (called <tt>readme.rb</tt>). Refer to
the repo to see these.</p>

<p><br><br><b><font size=+1>Syntax, comments, and more</font></b><br></p>

<p>At first, my idea was to provide predefined commands and allow user-defined commands (to be 
distinguished by a leading <tt>.</tt> or <tt>..</tt> markers). So the single and double dots are both legal. </p>

<p>However, my concept at present is that the double dots (currently unused) will be used for 
subcommmands.</p>

<p>User-defined commands may be added to the standard namespace marked with a period. They may
also be preceded by a specified character other than the period and thus stored in their own
namespace. More on that later.</p>

<p>When a leading period (or double period) is followed by a space, that line is a comment.
When it is follwed by a name, that name is typically understood to be a method name. Any 
remaining text on the line is treated as a parameter list to be accessed by that method.
Some methods accept multiple lines of text, terminated by a <tt>.end</tt> tag.</p>

<p><br><br><b><font size=+1>Boldface and italics</font></b><br></p>

<p>Very commonly we want to format short words or phrases in italics, boldface, or a monospaced
(fixed width) font. The Markdown spec provides ways to do this that are fairly intuitive; but I
personally don&#39;t like them. My own notation works a different way.</p>

<p>First of all, note that these don&#39;t work across source lines; they&#39;re strictly intra-line.
You may need (for example) an italicized phrase that spans across a newline; at present, you&#39;ll
need a workaround for that.</p>

<p>I find that most short items I want to format are single tokens. Therefore I use a prefixed
character in front of such a token: Underscore for italics, asterisk for boldface, and backtick
for &quot;code font.&quot; The formatting ends when the first blank space is encountered, without any 
kind of suffixed character. (This behavior may change to include certain punctuation marks as
terminators.)</p>

<p>Of course, there are cases where this won&#39;t work; a formatted string may contain spaces, or it
may exclude characters before the blank space. In this case, we can use an opening parenthesis 
after the prefix and a closing parenthesis at the end of the string.</p>

<p>This means that it can be difficult to include a left paren inside a formatted token. I&#39;m thinking
about that. It also means that a &quot;literal&quot; prefix character must be escaped.</p>

<p>This is all summarized in this example (taken from one of the testcases):</p>

<p><br><br><b><font size=+1>Writing custom methods</font></b><br></p>

<p>Suppose you wanted to write a method called <tt>chapter</tt> that would simply
output a chapter number and title with certain heading tags and a
horizontal rule following. There is more than one way to do this.</p>

<p>The simplest way is just to define a method inline with the rest of 
the text. Here&#39;s an example.</p>

<pre>
     .comment
     This example shows how to define
     a simple method &quot;chapter&quot; inline
     .end
   
     . This is also a comment, by the way.
     .def chapter
        params = _args
        raise &quot;chapter: expecting at least two args&quot; unless params.size &gt; 1
        num, *title = params     # Chapter number + title
        title = title.join(&quot; &quot;)  # Join all words into one string
        text = &lt;&lt;-HTML
        &lt;h3&gt;Chapter #{num}&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;#{title}&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;hr&gt;
        HTML
        _puts text
     .end
     . Now let&#39;s invoke it...
     .chapter 1 Why I Went to the Woods
     It was the best of times, and you can call me Ishmael. The clocks
     were striking thirteen.
</pre>

<p>What can we see from this example? First of all, notice that the part
between <tt>.def</tt> and <tt>.end</tt> (the body of the method) really is just Ruby
code. The method takes no parameters because parameter passing is 
handled inside the Livetext engine and the instance variable <tt>@<em>args</tt> is
initialized to the contents of this array. We usually refer to the
<tt>@</em>args</tt> array only through the method <tt>_args</tt> which returns it.</p>

<p>The <tt>_args</tt> method is also an iterator. If a block is attached, that block
will be called for every argument.</p>

<p>We then create a string using these parameters and call it using the
<tt>_puts</tt> method. This really does do a <tt>puts</tt> call, but it applies it to
wherever the output is currently being sent (defaulting to STDOUT).</p>

<p>All the &quot;helper&quot; methods start with an underscore so as to avoid name
collisions. These are all stored in the <tt>Livetext::Helpers</tt> module
(which also has some methods you will never use).</p>

<p>Here is the HTML output of the previous example:</p>

<pre>
     &lt;h3&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h3&gt;
     &lt;h2&gt;Why I Went to the Woods&lt;/h2&gt;
     &lt;hr&gt;
     It was the best of times, and you can call me Ishmael. The clocks
     were striking thirteen.
</pre>

<p>What are some other helper methods? Here&#39;s a list.</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td width=3%><td width=10%><tt>_args</tt> </td><td> Returns an array of arguments for the method (or an enumerator for that array)

<p>I&#39;ll let that code stand on its own. Now suppose you wanted to allow columnar output. Let&#39;s
have the user specify a number of columns (from 1 to 5, defaulting to 1).</p>

<p>What if we wanted to store the code outside the text file? There is more than one way to 
do this.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume we have a file called <tt>mylib.rb</tt> in the same directory as the file we&#39;re processing.
(Issues such as paths and security have not been addressed yet.) We&#39;ll stick the actual Ruby code
in here (and nothing else).</p>

<pre>
   # File: mylib.rb
   
   def alpha
     cols = _args.first
     cols = &quot;1&quot; if cols == &quot;&quot;
     cols = cols.to_i
     raise &quot;Columns must be 1-5&quot; unless cols.between?(1,5)
     text = _body.join
     text.gsub!(/\n/, &quot; &quot;)
     words = text.split.sort
     words.each_slice(cols) do |row| 
       row.each {|w| _print &#39;%-15s&#39; % w }
       _puts 
     end
   end
</pre>

<p>Now the <tt>.lt</tt> file can be written this way:</p>

<pre>
    .mixin mylib
    Here is an alphabetized list:
   
    .alpha 3
    fishmonger anarchist aardvark glyph gryphon
    halcyon zymurgy mataeotechny zootrope
    pareidolia manicotti quark bellicose anamorphic
    cytology fusillade ectomorph
    .end
   
    I hope that worked a second time.
</pre>

<p>The output, of course, is the same.</p>

<p>There is an important feature that has not yet been implemented (the
<tt>require</tt> method). Like Ruby&#39;s <tt>require</tt>, it will grab Ruby code and 
load it; however, unlike <tt>mixin</tt>, it will load it into a customized
object and associate a new sigil with it. So for example, the command
<tt>.foobar</tt> would refer to a method in the <tt>Livetext::Standard</tt> class 
(whether predefined or user-defined). If we did a <tt>require</tt> on a file
and associated the sigil <tt>#</tt> with it, then <tt>#foobar</tt> would be a method
on that new custom object. I will implement this soon.</p>
